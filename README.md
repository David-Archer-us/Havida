# Havida

## This is a term project for building a book recommendation system based on book ratings and user data. We use data from “Goodreads” on https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home, mainly goodreads_books.json.gz and goodreads_interactions.csv

## This recommendation system will accept userID, title, and/or genre as inputs and recommend a book for the user.

## All code is ready to run on the Jupyter Notebook with Python 3.9+.

## Some major libraries used are pandas, surprise
